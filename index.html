        <h3>Who am I:</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently the VP of Engineering for
          <a href="https://www.takeoutcentral.com">Takeout Central</a>, which is
          where most of my focus lies. The work I'm doing here involves backend
          engineering and systems programming while managing a small team of
          developers and contractors. My previous work history can be found on
          my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerenoe/">LinkedIn</a>.
          Outside of work, I can be found running the beautiful trails around
          Chapel Hill or blogging and working on side projects. I'm currently
          accepting short-term freelance work and can be contacted below. I also
          love a good cup of coffee and would be happy to meet and get to know
          you. Don't hesitate to reach out.

        <h3>Services:</h3>
        <h4>Full-Stack Consultation</h4>
        <p>
          I've worked with some of the oldest and esoteric systems you can
          imagine and in some cases improved page load speeds by 150% for data
          heavy report sites. I've also managed remote teams of designers, app
          developers and systems engineers both contract and in-house. If you
          just need someone with your product's interest at heart to get a move
          on a project, I'm your man.
        </p>
        <h4>Back End Development</h4>
        <p>
          Back end development is bringing the interactivity of your front end
          to life. I can clean up your old code base into something more
          maintainable and future proof or build you something brand new to get
          yourself off the ground. A login screen isn't helpful without a secure
          database full of users.
